# flask-example-with-precommit

A very simple barebones example of a Flask Application with some pre-commit hooks.

How to run:

With the pre-commit hooks
```
git clone
cd flask-example/flaskexample
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```

Without hooks
```
git clone 
cd flask-example/flaskexample
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```
